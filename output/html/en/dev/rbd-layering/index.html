<h1>RBD Layering<a class="headerlink" href="#rbd-layering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>RBD layering refers to the creation of copy-on-write clones of block
devices. This allows for fast image creation, for example to clone a
golden master image of a virtual machine into a new instance. To
simplify the semantics, you can only create a clone of a snapshot -
snapshots are always read-only, so the rest of the image is
unaffected, and there&#8217;s no possibility of writing to them
accidentally.</p>
<p>From a user&#8217;s perspective, a clone is just like any other rbd image.
You can take snapshots of them, read/write them, resize them, etc.
There are no restrictions on clones from a user&#8217;s viewpoint.</p>
<p>Note: the terms <cite>child</cite> and <cite>parent</cite> below mean an rbd image created
by cloning, and the rbd image snapshot a child was cloned from.</p>
<div class="section" id="command-line-interface">
<h2>Command line interface<a class="headerlink" href="#command-line-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before cloning a snapshot, you must mark it as protected, to prevent
it from being deleted while child images refer to it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ rbd snap protect pool/image@snap</pre>
</div>
<p>Then you can perform the clone:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ rbd clone [--parent] pool/parent@snap [--image] pool2/child1</pre>
</div>
<p>You can create a clone with different object sizes from the parent:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ rbd clone --order 25 pool/parent@snap pool2/child2</pre>
</div>
<p>To delete the parent, you must first mark it unprotected, which checks
that there are no children left:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ rbd snap unprotect pool/image@snap
Cannot unprotect: Still in use by pool2/image2
$ rbd children pool/image@snap
pool2/child1
pool2/child2
$ rbd flatten pool2/child1
$ rbd rm pool2/child2
$ rbd snap rm pool/image@snap
Cannot remove a protected snapshot: pool/image@snap
$ rbd snap unprotect pool/image@snap</pre>
</div>
<p>Then the snapshot can be deleted like normal:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ rbd snap rm pool/image@snap</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h2>Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="data-flow">
<h3>Data Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#data-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the initial implementation, called &#8216;trivial layering&#8217;, there will
be no tracking of which objects exist in a clone. A read that hits a
non-existent object will attempt to read from the parent snapshot, and
this will continue recursively until an object exists or an image with
no parent is found. This is done through the normal read path from
the parent, so differing object sizes between parents and children
do not matter.</p>
<p>Before a write to an object is performed, the object is checked for
existence. If it doesn&#8217;t exist, a copy-up operation is performed,
which means reading the relevant range of data from the parent
snapshot and writing it (plus the original write) to the child
image. To prevent races with multiple writes trying to copy-up the
same object, this copy-up operation will include an atomic create. If
the atomic create fails, the original write is done instead. This
copy-up operation is implemented as a class method so that extra
metadata can be stored by it in the future. In trivial layering, the
copy-up operation copies the entire range needed to the child object
(that is, the full size of the child object). A future optimization
could make this copy-up more fine-grained.</p>
<p>Another future optimization could be storing a bitmap of which objects
actually exist in a child. This would obviate the check for existence
before each write, and let reads go directly to the parent if needed.</p>
<p>These optimizations are discussed in:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://marc.info/?l=ceph-devel&amp;m=129867273303846">http://marc.info/?l=ceph-devel&amp;m=129867273303846</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parent-child-relationships">
<h3>Parent/Child relationships<a class="headerlink" href="#parent-child-relationships" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Children store a reference to their parent in their header, as a tuple
of (pool id, image id, snapshot id). This is enough information to
open the parent and read from it.</p>
<p>In addition to knowing which parent a given image has, we want to be
able to tell if a protected snapshot still has children. This is
accomplished with a new per-pool object, <cite>rbd_children</cite>, which maps
(parent pool id, parent image id, parent snapshot id) to a list of
child image ids. This is stored in the same pool as the child image
because the client creating a clone already has read/write access to
everything in this pool, but may not have write access to the parent&#8217;s
pool. This lets a client with read-only access to one pool clone a
snapshot from that pool into a pool they have full access to. It
increases the cost of unprotecting an image, since this needs to check
for children in every pool, but this is a rare operation. It would
likely only be done before removing old images, which is already much
more expensive because it involves deleting every data object in the
image.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="protection">
<h3>Protection<a class="headerlink" href="#protection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Internally, protection_state is a field in the header object that
can be in three states. &#8220;protected&#8221;, &#8220;unprotected&#8221;, and
&#8220;unprotecting&#8221;. The first two are set as the result of &#8220;rbd
protect/unprotect&#8221;. The &#8220;unprotecting&#8221; state is set while the &#8220;rbd
unprotect&#8221; command checks for any child images. Only snapshots in the
&#8220;protected&#8221; state may be cloned, so the &#8220;unprotected&#8221; state prevents
a race like:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A: walk through all pools, look for clones, find none</li>
<li>B: create a clone</li>
<li>A: unprotect parent</li>
<li>A: rbd snap rm <a class="reference external" href="mailto:pool/parent&#37;&#52;&#48;snap">pool/parent<span>&#64;</span>snap</a></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resizing">
<h3>Resizing<a class="headerlink" href="#resizing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Resizing an rbd image is like truncating a sparse file. New space is
treated as zeroes, and shrinking an rbd image deletes the contents
beyond the old bounds. This means that if you have a 10G image full of
data, and you resize it down to 5G and then up to 10G again, the last
5G is treated as zeroes (and any objects that held that data were
removed when the image was shrunk).</p>
<p>Layering complicates this because the absence of an object no longer
implies it should be treated as zeroes - if the object is part of a
clone, it may mean that some data needs to be read from the parent.</p>
<p>To preserve the resizing behavior for clones, we need to keep track of
which objects could be stored in the parent. We can track this as the
amount of overlap the child has with the parent, since resizing only
changes the end of an image. When a child is created, its overlap
is the size of the parent snapshot. On each subsequent resize, the
overlap is <cite>min(overlap, new_size)</cite>. That is, shrinking the image
may shrinks the overlap, but increasing the image&#8217;s size does not
change the overlap.</p>
<p>Objects that do not exist past the overlap are treated as zeroes.
Objects that do not exist before that point fall back to reading
from the parent.</p>
<p>Since this overlap changes over time, we store it as part of the
metadata for a snapshot as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="renaming">
<h3>Renaming<a class="headerlink" href="#renaming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently the rbd header object (that stores all the metadata about an
image) is named after the name of the image. This makes renaming
disrupt clients who have the image open (such as children reading from
a parent). To avoid this, we can name the header object by the
id of the image, which does not change. That is, the name of the
header object could be <cite>rbd_header.$id</cite>, where $id is a unique id for
the image in the pool.</p>
<p>When a client opens an image, all it knows is the name. There is
already a per-pool <cite>rbd_directory</cite> object that maps image names to
ids, but if we relied on it to get the id, we could not open any
images in that pool if that single object was unavailable. To avoid
this dependency, we can store the id of an image in an object called
<cite>rbd_id.$image_name</cite>, where $image_name is the name of the image. The
per-pool <cite>rbd_directory</cite> object is still useful for listing all images
in a pool, however.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="header-changes">
<h2>Header changes<a class="headerlink" href="#header-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The header needs a few new fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>int64_t parent_pool_id</li>
<li>string parent_image_id</li>
<li>uint64_t parent_snap_id</li>
<li>uint64_t overlap (how much of the image may be referring to the parent)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are stored in a &#8220;parent&#8221; key, which is only present if the image
has a parent.</p>
<div class="section" id="cls-rbd">
<h3>cls_rbd<a class="headerlink" href="#cls-rbd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some new methods are needed:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>/***************** methods on the rbd header *********************/
/**
 * Sets the parent and overlap keys.
 * Fails if any of these keys exist, since the image already
 * had a parent.
 */
set_parent(uint64_t pool_id, string image_id, uint64_t snap_id)

/**
 * returns the parent pool id, image id, snap id, and overlap, or -ENOENT
 * if parent_pool_id does not exist or is -1
 */
get_parent(uint64_t snapid)

/**
 * Removes the parent key
 */
remove_parent() // after all parent data is copied to the child

/*************** methods on the rbd_children object *****************/

add_child(uint64_t parent_pool_id, string parent_image_id,
          uint64_t parent_snap_id, string image_id);
remove_child(uint64_t parent_pool_id, string parent_image_id,
             uint64_t parent_snap_id, string image_id);
/**
 * List ids of a given parent
 */
get_children(uint64_t parent_pool_id, string parent_image_id,
             uint64_t parent_snap_id, uint64_t max_return,
             string start);
/**
 * list parent
 */
get_parents(uint64_t max_return, uint64_t start_pool_id,
            string start_image_id, string start_snap_id);


/************ methods on the rbd_id.$image_name object **************/

set_id(string id)
get_id()

/************** methods on the rbd_directory object *****************/

dir_get_id(string name);
dir_get_name(string id);
dir_list(string start_after, uint64_t max_return);
dir_add_image(string name, string id);
dir_remove_image(string name, string id);
dir_rename_image(string src, string dest, string id);</pre>
</div>
<p>Two existing methods will change if the image supports
layering:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>snapshot_add - stores current overlap and has_parent with
               other snapshot metadata (images that don't have
               layering enabled aren't affected)

set_size     - will adjust the parent overlap down as needed.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="librbd">
<h3>librbd<a class="headerlink" href="#librbd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Opening a child image opens its parent (and this will continue
recursively as needed). This means that an ImageCtx will contain a
pointer to the parent image context. Differing object sizes won&#8217;t
matter, since reading from the parent will go through the parent
image context.</p>
<p>Discard will need to change for layered images so that it only
truncates objects, and does not remove them. If we removed objects, we
could not tell if we needed to read them from the parent.</p>
<p>A new clone method will be added, which takes the same arguments as
create except size (size of the parent image is used).</p>
<p>Instead of expanding the rbd_info struct, we will break the metadata
retrieval into several API calls.  Right now, the only users of
rbd_stat() other than &#8216;rbd info&#8217; only use it to retrieve image size.</p>
