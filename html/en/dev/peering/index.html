<div class="section" id="description-of-the-peering-process">
<h2>Description of the Peering Process<a class="headerlink" href="#description-of-the-peering-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Golden Rule</em> is that no write operation to any PG
is acknowledged to a client until it has been persisted
by all members of the <em>acting set</em> for that PG.  This means
that if we can communicate with at least one member of
each <em>acting set</em> since the last successful <em>peering</em>, someone
will have a record of every (acknowledged) operation
since the last successful <em>peering</em>.
This means that it should be possible for the current
primary to construct and disseminate a new <em>authoritative history</em>.</p>
<p>It is also important to appreciate the role of the OSD map
(list of all known OSDs and their states, as well as some
information about the placement groups) in the <em>peering</em>
process:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When OSDs go up or down (or get added or removed)
this has the potential to affect the <em>active sets</em>
of many placement groups.</p>
<p>Before a primary successfully completes the <em>peering</em>
process, the OSD map must reflect that the OSD was alive
and well as of the first epoch in the <em>current interval</em>.</p>
<p>Changes can only be made after successful <em>peering</em>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thus, a new primary can use the latest OSD map along with a recent
history of past maps to generate a set of <em>past intervals</em> to
determine which OSDs must be consulted before we can successfully
<em>peer</em>.  The set of past intervals is bounded by <em>last epoch started</em>,
the most recent <em>past interval</em> for which we know <em>peering</em> completed.
The process by with an OSD discovers a PG exists in the first place is
by exchanging <em>PG info</em> messages, so the OSD always has some lower
bound on <em>last epoch started</em>.</p>
<p>The high level process is for the current PG primary to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">get a recent OSD map (to identify the members of the all
interesting <em>acting sets</em>, and confirm that we are still the
primary).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">generate a list of <em>past intervals</em> since <em>last epoch started</em>.
Consider the subset of those for which <em>up_thru</em> was greater than
the first interval epoch by the last interval epoch&#8217;s OSD map; that is,
the subset for which <em>peering</em> could have completed before the <em>acting
set</em> changed to another set of OSDs.</p>
<p>Successful <em>peering</em> will require that we be able to contact at
least one OSD from each of <em>past interval</em>&#8216;s <em>acting set</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">ask every node in that list for its <em>PG info</em>, which includes the most
recent write made to the PG, and a value for <em>last epoch started</em>.  If
we learn about a <em>last epoch started</em> that is newer than our own, we can
prune older <em>past intervals</em> and reduce the peer OSDs we need to contact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>if anyone else has (in its PG log) operations that I do not have,
instruct them to send me the missing log entries so that the primary&#8217;s
<em>PG log</em> is up to date (includes the newest write)..</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="5">
<li><p class="first">for each member of the current <em>acting set</em>:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">ask it for copies of all PG log entries since <em>last epoch start</em>
so that I can verify that they agree with mine (or know what
objects I will be telling it to delete).</p>
<p>If the cluster failed before an operation was persisted by all
members of the <em>acting set</em>, and the subsequent <em>peering</em> did not
remember that operation, and a node that did remember that
operation later rejoined, its logs would record a different
(divergent) history than the <em>authoritative history</em> that was
reconstructed in the <em>peering</em> after the failure.</p>
<p>Since the <em>divergent</em> events were not recorded in other logs
from that <em>acting set</em>, they were not acknowledged to the client,
and there is no harm in discarding them (so that all OSDs agree
on the <em>authoritative history</em>).  But, we will have to instruct
any OSD that stores data from a divergent update to delete the
affected (and now deemed to be apocryphal) objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">ask it for its <em>missing set</em> (object updates recorded
in its PG log, but for which it does not have the new data).
This is the list of objects that must be fully replicated
before we can accept writes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">at this point, the primary&#8217;s PG log contains an <em>authoritative history</em> of
the placement group, and the OSD now has sufficient
information to bring any other OSD in the <em>acting set</em> up to date.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">if the primary&#8217;s <em>up_thru</em> value in the current OSD map is not greater than
or equal to the first epoch in the <em>current interval</em>, send a request to the
monitor to update it, and wait until receive an updated OSD map that reflects
the change.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">for each member of the current <em>acting set</em>:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>send them log updates to bring their PG logs into agreement with
my own (<em>authoritative history</em>) ... which may involve deciding
to delete divergent objects.</li>
<li>await acknowledgment that they have persisted the PG log entries.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">at this point all OSDs in the <em>acting set</em> agree on all of the meta-data,
and would (in any future <em>peering</em>) return identical accounts of all
updates.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">start accepting client write operations (because we have unanimous
agreement on the state of the objects into which those updates are
being accepted).  Note, however, that if a client tries to write to an
object it will be promoted to the front of the recovery queue, and the
write willy be applied after it is fully replicated to the current <em>acting set</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">update the <em>last epoch started</em> value in our local <em>PG info</em>, and instruct
other <em>active set</em> OSDs to do the same.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">start pulling object data updates that other OSDs have, but I do not.  We may
need to query OSDs from additional <em>past intervals</em> prior to <em>last epoch started</em>
(the last time <em>peering</em> completed) and following <em>last epoch clean</em> (the last epoch that
recovery completed) in order to find copies of all objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">start pushing object data updates to other OSDs that do not yet have them.</p>
<p>We push these updates from the primary (rather than having the replicas
pull them) because this allows the primary to ensure that a replica has
the current contents before sending it an update write.  It also makes
it possible for a single read (from the primary) to be used to write
the data to multiple replicas.  If each replica did its own pulls,
the data might have to be read multiple times.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="10">
<li><p class="first">once all replicas store the all copies of all objects (that
existed prior to the start of this epoch) we can update <em>last
epoch clean</em> in the <em>PG info</em>, and we can dismiss all of the
<em>stray</em> replicas, allowing them to delete their copies of objects
for which they are no longer in the <em>acting set</em>.</p>
<p>We could not dismiss the <em>strays</em> prior to this because it was possible
that one of those <em>strays</em> might hold the sole surviving copy of an
old object (all of whose copies disappeared before they could be
replicated on members of the current <em>acting set</em>).</p>
</li>
